title: Precached - A Linux process monitor and pre-caching daemon
---

<p>Precached is written in Rust and utilises the Linux netlink connector interface
to monitor the system for process events. It can act upon such events via
multiple means. E.g. in the future it will be able to pre-fault pages into
memory to speed up loading of programs and increase the
perceived snappiness of the system.</p>

<h3>Quick install guide</h3>
    $ git clone https://github.com/X3n0m0rph59/precached.git  
    $ cd precached/
    $ cargo build

<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>This project is in a very early stage of development and you may
