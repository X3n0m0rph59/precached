<h1>Precached Project Website</h1>

<h2>A Linux process monitor and pre-caching daemon</h2>

<p>Precached is written in Rust and utilizes the Linux Netlink connector
  interface to monitor the system for process events. It can act upon such
  events via multiple means. E.g. it is able to pre-fault pages into memory,
  to speed up loading of programs and increase the perceived overall
  'snappiness' of the system. Additionally it supports offline prefetching of
  the most often used programs while the system is idle.</p>
