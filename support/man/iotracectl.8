.SH DESCRIPTION
.SH FLAGS
 -a, --ascii   Produce ASCII output instead of using Unicode for line drawing
 -h, --help    Prints help information
 -v            Sets the level of output verbosity
 -V, --version Prints version information
.SH OPTIONS
 -c, --config <file>  The precached config file to use [default: /etc/precached/precached.conf]
.SH SUBCOMMANDS
 status        Show the current status of the precached I/O tracing subsystem
 top           Top/htop like display of in-flight I/O traces
 list          List all available I/O traces
 info          Print metadata information about specific I/O traces
 dump          Dump I/O trace log entries (file access operations)
 analyze       Analyze I/O trace logs (check for missing files)
 optimize      Optimize I/O trace logs (optimize access patterns)
 blacklist     Manages the dynamic blacklist (see below)
 remove        Remove I/O trace
 clear         Completely clear all I/O traces and reset the precached I/O tracing subsystem
 help          Display this short help text
.SH MANAGING THE DYNAMIC BLACKLIST
 iotracectl blacklist [SUBCOMMAND] [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

 add           Add one or more I/O trace logs to the dynamic blacklist
 remove        Remove one or more I/O trace logs from the dynamic blacklist
 
.SH NOTES
 I/O trace logs generated by precached can have multiple attributes associated with them:

 Valid          The I/O trace is valid and will be used by the precached prefetcher
 Invalid        The I/O trace is invalid and will not be used by the precached prefetcher

 Fresh          The I/O trace is younger than the expiry time
 Expired        The I/O trace is old and expired, though it maybe still useful
                (precached will re-trace the associated executable on next execution)

 Current        The I/O trace is younger than the modification time of the corresponding binary
 Binary Newer   The binary that has been traced got updated, making the trace irrelevant
                (precached will re-trace the associated executable on next execution)

 Missing Binary The traced binary is no longer there, maybe it got deleted by the package manager
